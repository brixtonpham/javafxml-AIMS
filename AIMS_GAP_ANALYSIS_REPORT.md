## 2. Critical Gaps Analysis

### 2.1 High-Priority Gaps
These gaps pose significant risks to system functionality and business requirements compliance.

#### 2.1.1 GAP-001: LP Records Product Type Missing
**Problem Statement Requirement:** *"LP records have similar information requirements to CDs"*
- **Current Status:** ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- **Impact:** Product catalog incomplete, cannot sell LP records
- **Evidence:** No LP entity found in [`src/main/java/com/aims/core/entities/`](src/main/java/com/aims/core/entities/)
- **Business Impact:** Revenue loss from LP record sales
- **Technical Complexity:** Low (similar to CD implementation)

**Required Implementation:**
```java
// Missing: LP.java entity similar to CD.java
@Entity
@Table(name = "LP")
@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name = "productID")
public class LP extends Product {
    // Similar fields to CD: artists, recordLabel, tracklist, genre, releaseDate
}
```

#### 2.1.2 GAP-002: Performance Requirements Validation
**Problem Statement Requirements:** 
- *"Serve up to 1,000 customers simultaneously"*
- *"Operate continuously for 300 hours without failure"*
- *"Maximum response time 2 seconds (normal), 5 seconds (peak)"*

- **Current Status:** 🔍 **NOT VALIDATED**
- **Impact:** Unknown system scalability and reliability
- **Evidence:** No load testing, performance monitoring, or reliability testing found
- **Business Impact:** Potential system failures during high usage
- **Technical Complexity:** Medium (requires testing infrastructure)

**Required Validation:**
- Load testing with 1,000 concurrent users
- 300-hour reliability testing
- Response time monitoring implementation
- Performance benchmarking

#### 2.1.3 GAP-003: Disaster Recovery & System Recovery
**Problem Statement Requirement:** *"Resume normal operation within a maximum of 1 hour after an incident"*

- *"Additional 2,500 VND for every subsequent 0.5kg"*

- **Current Status:** ⚠️ **IMPLEMENTATION UNCLEAR**
- **Impact:** Incorrect delivery fee calculations
- **Evidence:** [`IDeliveryCalculationService.java`](src/main/java/com/aims/core/application/services/IDeliveryCalculationService.java) exists but calculation logic needs verification
- **Business Impact:** Revenue loss or customer overcharging
- **Technical Complexity:** Low (calculation logic implementation)

#### 2.2.3 GAP-006: Daily Operation Limits Enforcement
**Problem Statement Requirements:**
- *"Cannot delete or update more than 30 products per day"*
- *"Update price up to twice a day"*

- **Current Status:** ⚠️ **INTERFACE DEFINED, ENFORCEMENT UNCLEAR**
- **Impact:** Business rules may be violated
- **Evidence:** [`IProductService.java:113,138`](src/main/java/com/aims/core/application/services/IProductService.java:113) includes managerId tracking but enforcement unclear
- **Business Impact:** Potential abuse of product management functions
- **Technical Complexity:** Low (tracking and validation logic)

### 2.3 Low-Priority Gaps

#### 2.3.1 GAP-007: Price Constraint Enforcement
**Problem Statement Requirement:** *"Price must be between 30% and 150% of product value"*
- **Current Status:** ⚠️ **INTERFACE DEFINED, ENFORCEMENT UNCLEAR**
- **Impact:** Product pricing rules may be violated
