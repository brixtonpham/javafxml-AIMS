    private final Map<String, Long> stepTimestamps;
    private long totalDuration;
    // Implementation tracks complete customer workflows
}

// Multi-service coordination testing
private void testCompleteCartToOrderConversionWithFullValidation() {
    // Phase 1: Cart validation
    // Phase 2: Stock validation  
    // Phase 3: Order creation
    // Phase 4: Post-creation validation
    // Phase 5: State management validation
}

// Business rule compliance validation
private void testRushOrderLocationEligibility() {
    // Systematic validation of all geographic rules
    // Both positive and negative test cases
    // Edge case handling verification
}
```

### Performance Monitoring Integration
```java
// Real-time performance tracking
private Map<String, Long> performanceMetrics;

// Performance validation in tests
assertTrue(journey.getTotalDuration() < 3000, 
    "Product discovery journey should complete within 3 seconds");

// Concurrent operation testing
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numberOfCarts);
// Validate thread-safety and performance under load
```

### Comprehensive Error Handling
```java
// Graceful error recovery testing
assertThrows(Exception.class, () -> {
    cartService.addItem(cartSessionId, limitedProduct.getProductId(), 2);
}, "Should throw exception when trying to add more items than available");

// Business rule violation testing
assertFalse(invalidStockCheck.isValid(), 
    "Should prevent adding 4 items when only 3 are in stock");
```
