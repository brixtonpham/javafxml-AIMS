## Implementation Date
June 15, 2025

## Components Implemented

### 1. OrderValidationStateManager
**File**: `src/main/java/com/aims/core/presentation/utils/OrderValidationStateManager.java`

**Purpose**: Thread-safe validation state management across navigation to prevent validation bypass issues.

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Concurrent state tracking with ConcurrentHashMap for thread safety
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of expired validation states (2-hour expiry)
- ✅ Navigation context tracking for debugging
- ✅ Validation bypass detection and prevention
- ✅ Business rule validation with comprehensive error reporting
- ✅ State preservation across screen transitions
- ✅ Performance monitoring and metrics collection

**Core Functionality**:
```java
// Create validation state
String stateId = stateManager.createValidationState(
    orderId, 
    ValidationStep.DELIVERY_INFO_VALIDATION, 
    ValidationResult.PASSED, 
    "Delivery info validated"
);

// Check validation preservation
boolean hasValidation = stateManager.hasValidValidation(
    orderId, 
    ValidationStep.DELIVERY_INFO_VALIDATION
);

// Comprehensive order validation
ValidationSummary summary = stateManager.validateOrderForPayment(order);
```

### 2. PaymentFlowLogger
**File**: `src/main/java/com/aims/core/presentation/utils/PaymentFlowLogger.java`

**Purpose**: Specialized logger for payment flow debugging with structured logging for analysis tools.

**Key Features**:

- ✅ Structured log format: `[TIMESTAMP] [LEVEL] [CATEGORY] [SESSION] [ORDER] MESSAGE`

**Core Functionality**:
```java
// Start session
String sessionId = flowLogger.startPaymentFlowSession(orderId);

// Log navigation
flowLogger.logNavigationStep(sessionId, "ORDER_SUMMARY", "PAYMENT_METHOD", data);

// Log validation
flowLogger.logValidationStep(sessionId, "DELIVERY_VALIDATION", true, "Success", data);

    order.getOrderId(), 
    ValidationStep.ORDER_SUMMARY_VALIDATION
);
```

### Error Handling
```java
try {
    // Payment flow operation
} catch (Exception e) {
    flowLogger.logCriticalError(sessionId, "PAYMENT_PROCESSING_ERROR", e,
        Map.of("order_id", order.getOrderId(), "context", "payment_method_selection"));
    throw e;
}
