# TailwindCSS v4.x Migration & AIMS E-commerce Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

**Critical Issue Identified:** TailwindCSS v4.1.10 with incompatible v3.x configuration syntax causing `px-4` utility class failures.

**Solution Scope:** Complete TailwindCSS v4.x migration with comprehensive AIMS e-commerce implementation including shadcn/ui integration, product catalog, shopping cart, checkout flow, payment processing, and admin management.

## Problem Analysis

### Root Cause Analysis
- **TailwindCSS Version Mismatch:** Using v4.1.10 with v3.x configuration format
- **PostCSS Configuration:** Incorrect setup for v4.x processing pipeline
- **Config File Format:** `tailwind.config.js` uses deprecated v3.x syntax
- **CSS Processing:** Utility classes not being generated due to config incompatibility

### Impact Assessment
- **Immediate:** All TailwindCSS utility classes (px-4, etc.) not working
- **Development:** Build process failing for styling
- **Business:** E-commerce UI components not rendering correctly
- **User Experience:** Broken layouts and styling across the application

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: TailwindCSS v4.x Migration (Priority 1)

#### 1.1 Configuration Pipeline Fix
**Objective:** Resolve immediate `px-4` utility class recognition issue

**Key Changes:**
- **File:** `tailwind.config.js`
  - Convert from JavaScript config to CSS-based v4.x format
  - Remove deprecated `content` array syntax
  - Update plugin configuration for v4.x compatibility

  - Verify `@tailwindcss/postcss` import is correct
  - Update processing order for v4.x

- **File:** `src/index.css`
  - Add v4.x CSS configuration directives
  - Update @layer configurations for v4.x compatibility
  - Fix custom property definitions

**Expected Outcome:** All TailwindCSS utility classes working correctly

#### 1.2 Package Dependencies Update
**Dependencies to Review:**
- `@tailwindcss/line-clamp` → Check v4.x compatibility
- `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` → Ensure v4.x support
- Verify all Tailwind-related packages are v4.x compatible

### Phase 2: shadcn/ui Integration Setup

#### 2.1 Component Library Installation
**Components to Install:**
```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest init

- Free shipping: orders > 100,000 VND (max 25,000 VND discount)

**Rush Delivery (Hanoi inner city only):**
- 2-hour delivery window
- Additional 10,000 VND per rush item
- Separate delivery fee calculation
- Product eligibility validation
