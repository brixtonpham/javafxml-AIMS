## ðŸŽ¯ Technical Achievements

### **Responsive Design System**
- **4 Breakpoints**: Mobile (768px), Compact Desktop (1024px), Standard Desktop (1366px), Large Desktop (1920px+)
- **Dynamic CSS Classes**: Automatically applied based on window size
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Window resize triggers responsive class updates
- **Consistent Styling**: Unified design language across all components

### **Layout Infrastructure**
- **Flexible Containers**: All layouts use `USE_COMPUTED_SIZE` for dynamic sizing
- **Constraint-based Design**: Proper min/max/preferred size management
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Works on different screen sizes and resolutions
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient CSS loading and application

### **Component Enhancement**
- **Product Grid**: Adaptive card sizing and spacing based on screen size
- **Search Interface**: Responsive input fields and filter controls
- **Navigation**: Scalable menu and header system
- **Product Cards**: Consistent sizing with responsive constraints
